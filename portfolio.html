									<h2>a web developer</h2>

									<p>
										After working for more than 10 years in factoy jobs and not enjoying what I was doing or where my life was headed, I decided to resign and reorganize my life. My age and my experience have taught me the courage and dedication necessary to achieve the fruit of one's own efforts.
									</p>
									<p>
										I knew that the road would not be easy, but I was ready for the challenge and try to enjoy it. With some experience in graphic design due to my architecture career, I started studying self-taught and then in bootcamps.
